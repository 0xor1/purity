#Purity

Purity is a simple web framework for developing single page, real time web apps
with web sockets. Purity hides all of the server-client communications from the
developer and allows for the same app code to run completely on the client for 
quick and rapid testing cycles, or with a few additional lines of code split the
server side and client side ready for production mode. Purity is also a pattern
of code development which a Purity app must be developed in to work in the Purity
framework.
