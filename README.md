#Purity

Purity is both a coding pattern and a simple web framework for developing single
page, real time web apps with web sockets. Purity hides all of the server-client
communications from the developer and allows for the same app code to run
completely on the client for quick and rapid testing cycles, or with a few
additional lines of code, split the server side and client side ready for
production mode. Purity is currently in the early stages of development and so
only recommended for experimental use for now.
